Dynamic Pyramid Imple:

When a new donaiton is added and there is not room for it in the pyramid, it will prompt the user:
Would you like to adding this donation and automatticly repopulate the pyrmid, or would you like to edit it manually
There will be the ablity for the pyramid to dynamiclly change based on a donaiton, but also for the user to 
edit the pyramid themselves whenever they want with an edit button
